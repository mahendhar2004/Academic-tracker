# Bug Audit — Atrack (Academic Tracker)

Full repo bug sweep performed 2026-07-15, against `development` after merging in
`origin/main` (commit range up to `f7f8e69`). This is a Create React App SPA with no
traditional backend — Firebase (Auth/Firestore/Storage) is used as backend-as-a-service.
There is no separate "backend" codebase to audit; Firebase rules/config and the client's
Firestore access code are the closest equivalent.

Status legend: `[ ]` open, `[x]` fixed. Each phase below corresponds to a commit.

---

## Phase 2 — Critical (data loss / security / exploit) — DONE (`d0bc68a`)

- [x] **Account deletion destroys data with no recovery path.**
  `src/components/dashboard/ModalManager.jsx:103-116` (`confirmDeleteAccount`) calls
  `firestoreService.resetAllData(user.uid, user)` **before** `authService.deleteCurrentUser()`.
  Firebase's `deleteUser()` frequently throws `auth/requires-recent-login` unless the user
  signed in very recently. When that happens, `src/components/modals/ReauthModal.jsx` only
  offers "Sign Out" (wired to `onSignOut` in `ModalManager.jsx:194-198`) — it never retries
  the deletion after re-auth. Net effect: all Firestore data (courses, schedule, deadlines,
  tasks, contacts, expenditures, exam scenarios, profile) is permanently wiped, but the auth
  account survives with no way to finish or recover.

- [x] **Public profile leaks personal contact info with no consent.**
  `src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx` (`handleShareProfile`, ~line 59-77) copies
  `profileData.personal` (which always contains `email`/`phone`) wholesale into the public,
  unauthenticated `artifacts/${appId}/publicProfiles/{shareId}` Firestore document.
  `src/pages/PublicProfilePage.jsx:145,204-205` renders `personal.email`/`personal.phone` to
  any visitor with the link. Fix: add per-field opt-in toggles ("include email", "include
  phone") to the share flow; only include what the user explicitly opts into.

- [x] **Coin-reward exploit — unlimited farming on any list-type profile field.**
  `src/services/firebaseService.jsx:51` (`saveProfileFieldWithReward`):
  `profileData[field]` looks up a **dotted path** (e.g. `'academic.projects'`,
  `'academic.certificates'`, `'academic.internships'`, `'academic.resumes'`,
  `'personal.achievements'`, `'social.links'`) directly on the nested JS object, which is
  always `undefined`. So `oldListLength` is always `0`, meaning `itemsAdded = value.length`
  on **every** save — a user can add one item, delete it, re-add it, repeat, and farm coins
  indefinitely. Fix: resolve the dotted path against the nested object before comparing
  lengths.

- [ ] **Historical leaked Firebase project config in git history, on a public repo.**
  A real `apiKey`/`projectId`/etc. was committed in `8298fa4` and replaced with env vars in
  `4482e58`, but is still recoverable via `git log`/`git show` — and this repo
  (`github.com/mahendhar2004/Academic-tracker`) is **public**. Fix: scrub with
  `git-filter-repo` (destructive — rewrites every commit hash, requires a force-push;
  re-confirm immediately before doing this), and rotate/restrict the Firebase API key via
  the console regardless, since a public leak can't be un-leaked by a later history purge.

---

## Phase 3 — Crashes — DONE

- [x] **`PomodoroModal.jsx:73`** — `toast.info('Press ESC to cancel focus mode')`. `toast` is
  the Zustand **state object** (`{ show, message, type }`), not a function — only
  `showToast(message, type)` exists on `uiSlice.js`. Clicking "Start" throws
  `TypeError: toast.info is not a function` synchronously in the click handler. Fixed by
  destructuring `showToast` and calling it correctly.

- [x] **`src/components/common/GlobalSearch.jsx:56,60,64`** — `c.name.toLowerCase()`,
  `t.title.toLowerCase()` etc. with no null guard. Any course/task/contact document missing
  `name`/`title` throws on every keystroke in the Cmd+K search box. Fixed with `(x || '')`
  guards.

- [x] **`src/pages/HomePage.jsx`** — `.getTime()` called on a `null` date when a deadline has
  no `date` field. **Verified not reachable**: `useDashboardSummary.jsx`'s `upcomingDeadlines`
  filter already excludes any deadline whose `normalizeDate(d.date)` is null/invalid before it
  reaches `AtAGlance`, so `HomePage.jsx` never receives a deadline with an unparseable date.
  No code change needed here.

- [x] **`src/hooks/useDashboardSummary.jsx:42`** — `expenditures.reduce(...)` with no
  optional-chaining (unlike every sibling input: `schedule?.`, `deadlines?.`, `tasks?.`) —
  crashes if `expenditures` is `undefined`/`null` before the Firestore listener resolves.
  Fixed with `(expenditures || [])`, plus a `Number(item.amount) || 0` guard.

- [x] **`src/pages/PerformancePage.jsx` (~line 53)** — `Math.max(...courses.map(c =>
  c.semester))` with no guard → `NaN` if any course document lacks a `semester` field,
  silently blanking the whole Academic Journey timeline. Fixed via the shared
  `getMaxSemester` helper (see next item).

- [x] **`src/hooks/useAttendanceData.jsx` vs `PerformancePage.jsx`** — two independent,
  diverging implementations of "compute max semester". Unified into
  `src/utils/courses.js`'s `getMaxSemester`, also adopted by `ModalManager.jsx`'s third
  independent copy of the same logic.

- [x] **`src/pages/CalendarPage.jsx` (~line 46)** — `.localeCompare` on `startTime` crashes if
  a deadline has no `time` value. Fixed with `(a.startTime || '').localeCompare(b.startTime || '')`.
  While in this file: also fixed `selectedDate` never being wired to the mini calendar (day
  clicks now actually highlight, via a new `selectedDay` state distinct from the month-nav
  state), and `eventsByDate` being limited to a 7-day window regardless of viewed month (now
  computed per-viewed-month so "has events" dots are correct after navigating months).

- [x] **`src/pages/ExpenditurePage.jsx:46`** and **`useDashboardSummary.jsx:42`** — no guard
  against a document missing `amount`; one bad/legacy doc poisons the running total to `NaN`.
  Fixed with `Number(item.amount) || 0` guards, plus a new `toDateSafe` helper
  (`src/utils/date.js`) replacing unguarded `item.date.toDate()`/`.toMillis()` calls.

- [x] **`src/services/firebaseService.jsx` `resetExpenditures`/`resetAllData`** — single
  `writeBatch` deleting an entire collection could exceed Firestore's 500-op cap. Fixed with a
  `deleteAllDocs` helper that chunks deletes across as many batches as needed.

- [x] **Google Sign-In users never got a Firestore profile document created** — `App.jsx`'s
  `handleLogin('google')` now calls a new `ensureProfileDocument` after sign-in, creating the
  default profile doc if one doesn't already exist (mirroring what email sign-up already did).

---

## Phase 4 — Timezone off-by-one (one root cause, multiple sites) — DONE

Plain `"YYYY-MM-DD"` date-input strings are parsed via `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")`, which the
spec defines as **UTC midnight**, then re-displayed/compared using **local-time** getters
(`getFullYear`/`getMonth`/`getDate`, `toLocaleDateString`). For any user west of UTC, this
shows/compares dates one day earlier than what was actually saved. Fixed by adding
`parseLocalDateString`/`getLocalDateString` to `src/utils/date.js` and anchoring storage to
local midnight (matching how the rest of the app already reads dates back) instead of trying
to make every read site UTC-aware.

- [x] `src/services/firebaseService.jsx` `saveDeadline` — root cause; now anchors via
  `parseLocalDateString` before wrapping in a `Timestamp`, so `.toDate()` + local getters
  everywhere else (`AddEditDeadlineModal.jsx`, `HomePage.jsx`, `CalendarPage.jsx`) read back
  the same calendar day the user picked, in any timezone.
- [x] `src/components/modals/AddEditTaskModal.jsx` — "today" default now uses
  `getLocalDateString()` instead of `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` (which computed
  the UTC calendar date).
- [x] `src/components/planner/TaskCard.jsx` — due-date display now parses via
  `parseLocalDateString` instead of `new Date(task.dueDate)` before formatting.
- [x] `src/components/modals/AddEditExpenditureModal.jsx` — the date `<input>`'s prefill and
  onChange now both anchor to local midnight (`getLocalDateString`/`parseLocalDateString`)
  instead of mixing a UTC-anchored write with a local-anchored read.
- [x] **Verified not reachable / no behavior change needed**: `src/components/modals/AddEditClassModal.jsx`'s
  `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` "today" scratch value — it's only used to attach a
  throwaway date onto a `DateTimePicker` so a `HH:MM` time-of-day can be extracted back out via
  `toTimeString()` (local); the date portion is discarded before saving, so the UTC-vs-local
  choice here has no observable effect.
- Left alone (dead code, not reachable): `src/components/calendar/DeadlineCard.jsx` has the
  same bug pattern but is never imported anywhere — flagged for deletion in Phase 7 instead of
  fixing dead code.

---

## Phase 5 — State-mutation / React anti-patterns — DONE

- [x] **`src/hooks/usePerformanceGraphs.jsx:11`** — `semesters.sort((a, b) => a.semester -
  b.semester)` mutates the array in place. `semesters` is the same reference as
  `Dashboard.jsx`'s memoized `performanceData.semesters` (deliberately sorted **descending**
  there); this hook silently flips it to ascending as a side effect, without the source memo
  re-running. Fixed with `[...semesters].sort(...)`.
- [x] **`src/components/common/DateTimePicker.jsx`** — `currentMonth.setMonth(...)` mutated
  the state `Date` object directly before wrapping in `new Date(...)`. Fixed by deriving the
  new month via `new Date(prev.getFullYear(), prev.getMonth() ± 1, 1)` without touching `prev`.
- [x] **`src/components/common/DateTimePicker.jsx`** — selected-day highlight compared
  month/day but never checked the year. Fixed by adding a `getFullYear()` comparison.
- [x] **`src/App.jsx`** — `onAuthStateChanged` effect listed `user` in its own dependency
  array while also calling `setUser(user)` inside the callback, causing the listener to tear
  down and resubscribe on every auth transition. Fixed by tracking the initialized uid in a
  `useRef` instead of depending on `user` state.
- [x] **`src/App.jsx` (~lines 87-97)** — dead/half-finished commented-out code deciding
  whether to early-return for `/public/:id` routes. Resolved: the auth listener always
  subscribes (kept, since it's needed to keep a logged-in user's session alive even while
  viewing a public profile link); the early `setLoading(false)` for `/public/*` routes was
  split out into its own small effect; the indecisive comments were replaced with a plain
  statement of the actual, intended behavior.

---

## Phase 6 — Validation gaps — DONE

- [x] **`src/components/modals/AddCourseModal.jsx`** — no non-negative check on
  attended/total classes; negative attendance counts could be saved. Fixed with an explicit
  `attendedNum < 0 || totalNum < 0` check.
- [x] **`src/components/modals/AddGradeModal.jsx` / `AddCourseModal.jsx` / `PredictorPage.jsx`**
  — `credits > 0` was the only guard, no upper bound. Added a `<= 30` credit ceiling (HTML
  `max` + JS check) everywhere a credits field is entered. `PredictorPage.jsx`'s `targetCGPA`
  now rejects non-`(0, 10]` values instead of silently computing nonsense, and `futureCredits`
  is clamped to non-negative. (`WhatIfModal.jsx` has the same gap but is dead code — see
  Phase 7, deleting it rather than fixing validation in unreachable code.)
- [x] **`src/components/modals/AddEditTaskModal.jsx`** — title wasn't `.trim()`'d; fixed to
  validate and save the trimmed title.
- [x] **`src/components/modals/AddEditClassModal.jsx`** — no check that `endTime` is after
  `startTime`; fixed with an explicit check + error message on submit. Also fixed: nudging
  `startTime` silently reset the class duration to a fixed 1 hour — it now preserves whatever
  duration was already set.
- [x] **`src/components/profile/EditableResumeList.jsx`** — no `<form>` wrapper, so native
  `type="url"` HTML5 validation never fired; wrapped the add-item inputs in a real `<form>`
  with `required` attributes. (`EditProfileModal.jsx` has the same gap but is dead/unreachable
  code — see Phase 7, deleting it rather than fixing validation in unreachable code.)
- [x] **`src/components/modals/PomodoroModal.jsx`** — **verified already fixed by the
  `main` merge**: the free-text duration input that could go `NaN` no longer exists; duration
  is now chosen via fixed preset buttons (15/25/45/60 min), which can't produce an invalid
  value.
- [x] **`src/pages/LandingPage.jsx` + `src/components/modals/BugReportModal.jsx`** — both
  POST to Google Forms with `fetch(..., { mode: 'no-cors' })`, which always resolves as an
  opaque response — the code cannot detect a rejected/misconfigured submission. Standing up a
  server-side relay to get a real response is out of scope for a client-only app without
  discussing hosting for it, so fixed the honest way: softened the success copy ("is on its
  way" instead of "has been sent"/"has been submitted") and documented the `no-cors` limitation
  inline so it isn't mistaken for a solved problem later.

---

## Phase 7 — Dead code & duplication

- [ ] **`GRADE_POINTS`/`GRADES` duplicated in 5 files** instead of importing the canonical
  copy from `src/constants.js`: `AddGradeModal.jsx`, `WhatIfModal.jsx`, `AddCourseModal.jsx`,
  `usePerformanceGraphs.jsx`, `PredictorPage.jsx`. (Value confirmed intentional — `F` stays at
  2 grade points — only consolidate the imports, don't change the value.)
- [ ] **`src/components/modals/WhatIfModal.jsx`** — entire 390-line modal is unreachable dead
  code; superseded by `PredictorPage.jsx` but still wired into `ModalManager.jsx` behind a
  `modal === 'whatIf'` case that nothing ever triggers.
- [ ] **`src/components/modals/EditProfileModal.jsx`** — unreachable (nothing opens it) *and*
  its `onSave` is a no-op `console.log` stub in `ModalManager.jsx`.
- [ ] **`src/components/modals/ResetExpendituresModal.jsx`** — still unused; `Dashboard.jsx`
  uses a generic confirmation modal instead.
- [ ] **`src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`** — `onNavigateToLanding` prop passed but unused; a hard
  `<a href="/">` causes a full page reload instead of an SPA view switch.
- [ ] **`normalizeDate`** duplicated byte-for-byte between `useDashboardSummary.jsx` and
  `AtAGlance.jsx` — fold into the shared date utility from Phase 4.
- [ ] **`src/hooks/usePlannerTasks.jsx`** — sorts tasks only by time-of-day, ignoring
  `dueDate`; wrong ordering for multi-day long-term tasks.
- [ ] **`src/components/pomodoro/PomodoroTimer.jsx`** — recreates `setInterval` every tick
  instead of once per session.
- [ ] **`src/components/modals/TimetableModal.jsx`** — no guard for `schedule` being
  `undefined`/`null`; `timeToMinutes` silently returns `0` for malformed times, distorting the
  whole grid instead of skipping the bad entry.
- [ ] **`src/firebase/config.js`** — `appId` hardcoded to `'default-app-id'` despite a comment
  saying it should be env/config-driven.
- [ ] **Firestore path centralization gap** — `App.jsx`, `ProfilePage.jsx`,
  `PublicProfilePage.jsx` still hardcode `artifacts/${appId}/...` paths directly instead of
  using the new `src/constants/dbPaths.js`; that file doesn't even define a public-profile
  path helper yet.

---

## Phase 8 — Infra / config / repo hygiene

- [ ] **Broken icon references.** `public/index.html` still links `apple-touch-icon` to
  `logo192.png`, which doesn't exist in `public/`. `public/manifest.json` references
  `maskable_icon_x512.png`, which also doesn't exist (only `file.svg`, `index.html`,
  `manifest.json`, `robots.txt` are present in `public/`). Either add the real icon assets or
  remove the dangling references.
- [ ] **`public/index.html` meta description** is still literally `"Web site created using
  create-react-app"` (manifest.json branding was already fixed in the merge — this one
  wasn't).
- [ ] **`cors.json`** only allow-lists `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:5173`
  (the latter a Vite port this CRA project doesn't use) — no production origin at all. Needs
  the actual deployed domain to fix.
- [ ] **Dead dependencies in `package.json`**: `@reduxjs/toolkit`, `react-redux`, `three` —
  confirmed via grep, never imported anywhere in `src/` even after the store's slice refactor
  (which uses Zustand, not Redux).
- [ ] **Tailwind version mismatch** — `@tailwindcss/postcss@^4.1.11` is installed as a
  devDependency but `postcss.config.js` uses the v3-style plain `tailwindcss: {}` plugin, and
  the project is actually on `tailwindcss@^3.4.13`. Leftover from an abandoned v4 migration.
- [ ] **`src/App.test.js`** is untouched CRA boilerplate (`getByText(/learn react/i)`) —
  `npm test` fails immediately.
- [ ] **`README.md`** is 100% CRA boilerplate — no Firebase/env setup instructions at all (a
  new dev can't get the app running without knowing about the 6 required
  `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_*` vars), and has UTF-16 mojibake corruption appended at the end
  (`#   A t r a c k` — garbled from a bad shell redirect).
- [ ] **No `.env.example`** despite `src/firebase/config.js` requiring 6 env vars.
- [ ] **`.gitignore`** still missing `.DS_Store`, `.vscode/`/`.idea/`, `/coverage`, and a
  generic `*.log` rule.
- [ ] **A 4.9 MB screen recording (`Recording 2025-08-14 163900.mp4`) is committed at repo
  root** and still tracked post-merge — remove from the working tree; consider bundling into
  the same history-rewrite as the leaked secret if it should also be purged from history.
- [ ] **`eslint.json` (124 KB, UTF-16, newly added in this merge)** is an accidentally
  committed raw ESLint JSON report (`eslint --format json -o eslint.json`), containing
  absolute Windows filesystem paths from the author's machine. Pure accidental commit with no
  value to the repo — delete it.
- [ ] **`package.json` `"name": "semester-tracker"`** vs. the actual product name "Atrack"
  used everywhere else; no `engines` field constraining Node version.

---

## Already fixed by the `main` merge (verified, no action needed)

- `logo192.png`/`logo512.png`/CRA placeholder branding in `manifest.json` — rebranded to
  "Atrack - Academic Performance Tracker" (icon file references still broken, see Phase 8).
- `src/components/modals/AddExpenditureModal.jsx`, `SetBalanceModal.jsx`,
  `src/components/performance/WhatIfCalculator.jsx`, `src/components/profile/PersonalDetails.jsx`
  — all deleted as dead code in the merge.
